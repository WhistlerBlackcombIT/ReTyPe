	 * constructor, but validation is performed before refilling that would
	 * make this harder to achieve.
	 *
	 * Though the code here is inherited by all child Fluids, it is not yet
	 * necessary nor useful for Timer-based Fluids, only Hotkey-based.  This
	 * may change at a later date, and, if different enough, may be further
	 * separated in to two further child classes, presenting:
	 *     __ Fluid __
